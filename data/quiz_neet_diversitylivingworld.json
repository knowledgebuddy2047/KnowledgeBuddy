    "options": ["Penicillium", "Agaricus", "Neurospora", "Ustilago"],

    "question": "Which plant group is known as the 'amphibians of the plant kingdom'?",
    "options": ["Bryophytes", "Pteridophytes", "Gymnosperms", "Angiosperms"],
    "answer": "Bryophytes",
    "explanation": "Bryophytes grow on land but require water for fertilization, similar to how amphibians are partly terrestrial and partly aquatic."

  {
    "question": "In which group are seeds described as 'naked'?",
    "options": ["Ferns", "Bryophytes", "Gymnosperms", "Angiosperms"],
    "answer": "Gymnosperms",
    "explanation": "Gymnosperms bear seeds that are not enclosed in a fruit, hence the term 'naked seeds'."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a pseudocoelomate animal?",
    "options": ["Platyhelminthes", "Ascaris", "Annelida", "Arthropoda"],
    "answer": "Ascaris",
    "explanation": "Ascaris (a roundworm) belongs to Aschelminthes, which is a pseudocoelomate phylum: the body cavity is not fully lined by mesoderm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which kingdom includes multicellular, eukaryotic, autotrophic organisms?",
    "options": ["Monera", "Protista", "Fungi", "Plantae"],
    "answer": "Plantae",
    "explanation": "Kingdom Plantae includes multicellular, eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms such as algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms."
  },
  {
    "question": "The basic unit of classification is:",
    "options": ["Genus", "Order", "Species", "Class"],
    "answer": "Species",
    "explanation": "Species is the lowest and most fundamental taxonomic category; all higher taxa (genus, family, order, etc.) are built from one or more species."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of viruses?",
    "options": ["They show independent metabolism", "They are cellular organisms", "They can replicate only inside a host cell", "They contain both DNA and RNA simultaneously"],
    "answer": "They can replicate only inside a host cell",
    "explanation": "Viruses lack independent metabolic machinery and can only multiply by using the host cell’s protein‑synthesis and energy‑producing systems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is an example of a cyanobacterium?",
    "options": ["Escherichia", "Chlamydomonas", "Nostoc", "Agaricus"],
    "answer": "Nostoc",
    "explanation": "Nostoc is a filamentous, nitrogen‑fixing cyanobacterium often found in moist soil or water bodies."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a mismatched pair?",
    "options": ["Monera – Prokaryotes", "Protista – Mostly unicellular eukaryotes", "Fungi – Chitin in cell wall", "Animalia – Autotrophic"],
    "answer": "Animalia – Autotrophic",
    "explanation": "Members of Kingdom Animalia are heterotrophic (ingestive), not autotrophic; autotrophy is a feature of Kingdom Plantae."
  },
  {
    "question": "Lichens are a symbiotic association between:",
    "options": ["Fungus + bacteria", "Fungus + algae/cyanobacteria", "Algae + fern", "Algae + bryophyte"],
    "answer": "Fungus + algae/cyanobacteria",
    "explanation": "In lichens, the fungal partner (mycobiont) provides structure and protection, while the algal or cyanobacterial partner (phycobiont) performs photosynthesis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of pteridophytes?",
    "options": ["They are non‑vascular", "They lack true roots and leaves", "They have vascular tissues", "They produce seeds"],
    "answer": "They have vascular tissues",
    "explanation": "Pteridophytes are vascular cryptogams; they have xylem and phloem but do not produce seeds."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a feature of bryophytes?",
    "options": ["Well‑developed xylem and phloem", "Absence of vascular tissues", "Seeds enclosed in fruits", "Dominant sporophyte generation"],
    "answer": "Absence of vascular tissues",
    "explanation": "Bryophytes lack true vascular tissues and true roots, which is why they remain small and require moist environments."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following animal phyla shows radial symmetry?",
    "options": ["Platyhelminthes", "Cnidaria", "Aschelminthes", "Arthropoda"],

    "explanation": "Cnidarians (e.g., Hydra, Aurelia) exhibit radial symmetry, where body parts are arranged around a central axis."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is the correct sequence of taxonomic categories from general to specific?",
    "options": ["Species → Genus → Family → Order → Class → Phylum → Kingdom", "Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species", "Genus → Species → Family → Order → Class → Phylum → Kingdom", "Class → Order → Phylum → Family → Genus → Species → Kingdom"],
    "answer": "Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species",
